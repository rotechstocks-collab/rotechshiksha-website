"Ek kaam kar..."

## Humor Guidelines

### Acceptable Humor Styles

| Type | Example | Why It Works |
|------|---------|--------------|
| **Self-deprecating (Rohit)** | "Maine toh Sensex ko koi company samjha tha!" | Relatable, doesn't mock others |
| **Situational** | "Bas, ab tu next Warren Buffett ban jayega!" (sarcastically) | Light teasing between friends |
| **Analogies gone funny** | "SIP is like chai subscription - har mahine thoda thoda, but taste badiya!" | Educational + memorable |
| **Shared experience** | "Pehle main bhi sochti thi stock market gambling hai!" | Creates connection |

### Humor Boundaries - What to AVOID

| Type | Example | Why It's Wrong |
|------|---------|----------------|
| **Mocking the learner** | "Ye bhi nahi pata? Kahan rehte ho?" | Insulting, discouraging |
| **Cringe/forced jokes** | "Paisa hi paisa hoga!" with excessive excitement | Fake, inauthentic |
| **Pop culture forced** | Random movie dialogues that don't fit | Distracting |
| **Gender stereotypes** | "Ladkiyan finance nahi samajhti" | Offensive, wrong |
| **Age/education mocking** | "Padhe-likhe ho ya nahi?" | Insulting |
| **Religious/political** | Any reference | Keep content neutral |

### The "Chai Test"
Before including any joke, ask: "Would this be okay to say while explaining to a friend over chai?"

If yes: Include it
If no: Remove it

### 2. EXPLANATION (2-3 minutes)
**Purpose:** Explain the concept in simple Hinglish

**Format:**

```

**Rules:**

### 3. REAL-LIFE EXAMPLE (1-2 minutes)
**Purpose:** Make it concrete with Indian context

**Format:**
```

```

**Guidelines:**
- Use Indian names (Rahul, Neha, Sharma uncle)

**Example:**
```
Priya: "Maan le Rahul ne 22 saal ki age mein Rs 2000 monthly SIP start ki..."

```

Priya: "Daal Rs 3000 monthly, 25 saal, 12% expected return..."
Rohit: "Whoa! Rs 56 lakh? Just Rs 3000 se?"
Priya: "Haan, par dhyan de - tune total 9 lakh daale. Baaki sab compound growth!"
```

---

### 5. SUMMARY (30 seconds)

**Format:**
```
Priya: "Toh yaad rakh - [3 bullet points max]"
```

**Rules:**
- Maximum 3 points
- Each point under 10 words

3. Consistency > Large amount"
```

---

### 6. CALL-TO-ACTION (15 seconds)
**Purpose:** Tell them what to do next

## Sample Conversation: Complete Lesson

**Topic: What is SIP?**

---

**[HOOK]**

**Rohit:** Yaar Priya, office mein sab log SIP SIP bol rahe the. Maine haan haan kar di, par mujhe pata hi nahi ye kya hai!

**Priya:** Haha, tension mat le! Bahut log aise hi start karte hain. SIP actually bahut simple hai - chal samjhata hoon.

---

**[EXPLANATION]**

**Priya:** SIP matlab Systematic Investment Plan. Yaani har mahine ek fixed amount automatically mutual fund mein invest hota hai.

**Rohit:** Matlab... jaise EMI?

**Priya:** Bilkul! Par EMI mein tu loan chuka raha hai, SIP mein tu apne liye paisa jama kar raha hai. Netflix subscription jaisa samajh - har mahine same amount, automatic.

**Rohit:** Acha acha! Par ek saath daalne se zyada return nahi milega?

**Priya:** Ye common confusion hai! Ek saath daalne ko lumpsum bolte hain. SIP ka faayda ye hai ki tu market ki timing ki tension mat le. Kuch months market upar, kuch neeche - average out ho jaata hai. Ise "Rupee Cost Averaging" bolte hain.

**Rohit:** Oh! Matlab safe hai?

**Priya:** Safe nahi, but risk kam ho jaata hai. Aur discipline bhi aata hai - har mahine automatically kat jaata hai!

---

**[REAL-LIFE EXAMPLE]**

**Priya:** Chal, Sharma uncle ka example le. Unke do bete hain - Rahul aur Amit.

**Priya:** Rahul ne 22 saal ki age mein Rs 2000 monthly SIP start ki. Amit bola "Abhi nahi, baad mein karoonga" aur 30 pe start ki Rs 5000 se.

**Rohit:** Amit toh zyada daal raha hai!

**Priya:** Haan, par guess kar 60 ki age mein kiski jyada hogi?

**Rohit:** Amit ki?

**Priya:** Nope! Rahul ki - almost double! Kyunki uska paisa 8 saal extra compound hua. Time ki power, bhai!

**Rohit:** Damn! Mujhe abhi start karna chahiye tha!

---

**[TOOL DEMO]**

**Priya:** Chal, actually calculate karte hain. Rotech Shiksha pe SIP Calculator khol.

**Rohit:** Khola. Kya daalu?

**Priya:** Monthly SIP: Rs 3000, Time: 25 years, Expected Return: 12%

**Rohit:** Whoa! Rs 56 lakh? Sirf 3000 monthly se?

**Priya:** Haan! Aur dhyan se dekh - tune total daale Rs 9 lakh. Baaki 47 lakh? Woh compound growth hai!

**Rohit:** Bhai, ye toh sahi hai!

---

**[SUMMARY]**

**Priya:** Toh yaad rakh teen cheezein:
1. **SIP = Automatic monthly investment** - discipline ka solution
2. **Jaldi start karo** - amount chhota bhi chalega
3. **Consistency matters** - Rs 2000 30 saal > Rs 10000 10 saal

---

**[CTA]**

**Rohit:** Theek hai! Ab mujhe kya karna chahiye?

**Priya:** Pehle SIP Calculator se apni planning kar. Phir "Mutual Fund Basics" module dekh - wahan bataya hai SIP kahan start karein!
