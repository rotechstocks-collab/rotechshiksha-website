You are a senior product designer + full stack developer.
Redesign and restructure my website (rotechshiksha.com) to look like a modern professional stock market education platform similar to Zerodha Varsity + Groww, but keeping my content and pages.

IMPORTANT RULES:
1) Do NOT remove any existing page or route.
2) You may reorganize navigation and move sections between pages.
3) Improve UI/UX, responsiveness, typography, spacing, and consistency.
4) Keep fast-loading clean design (flat minimal professional).
5) Maintain all existing features: courses, levels, blog, calculators, economic calendar, live news, broker comparison, paper trading, pricing, FAQ.
6) Priya and Rohit are the same age, professional friends. Never portray them as siblings (brother-sister).

GOALS:
- Increase conversions for beginners
- Improve trust, retention, and readability
- Make the learning journey clear
- Add product-like polish (consistent design system)

TASKS TO DO:

A) GLOBAL DESIGN SYSTEM
- Create consistent typography system (h1,h2,h3, body, captions).
- Create consistent spacing system (8px/16px/24px/32px/48px).
- Create consistent button styles (primary, secondary, outline).
- Create consistent card styles (radius, shadow, padding).
- Apply across all pages.

B) HOMEPAGE (HIGH IMPACT)
- Create strong hero section:
  Title: "Stock Market Seekho — Bilkul Zero Se"
  Subtitle: "Simple Hindi + Story-based learning with Priya & Rohit."
  Add two CTA buttons:
    Primary: "Start Free Course"
    Secondary: "Explore Tools"
- Below hero, add "Why Rotech Shiksha?" section with 3 feature cards:
  1) Beginner Friendly Learning
  2) Story-based Hindi Explanation
  3) Tools + Practice
- Add "Learning Path Preview" section showing Level 1 → Level 2 → Advanced
- Add "Trust" section:
  show stats placeholders like learners count, lessons, hours saved.
- Add a footer with quick links and contact.

C) NAVIGATION RESTRUCTURE (DO NOT DELETE ANY PAGE)
- Make top nav clean and minimal:
  Home, Courses, Learning Path, Tools, Blog, News, Pricing
- Put secondary items inside dropdown or footer links:
  Economic Calendar, Broker Compare, Paper Trading, FAQ

D) COURSES + LEARNING PATH IMPROVEMENT
- Reduce unnecessary white space.
- Make cards larger and easier to scan.
- Add progress tracker bar at top.
- Locked courses should show clear reason: "Unlock after completing Level 1"
- Add “Continue Learning” button to resume last lesson.

E) LESSON PAGES TEMPLATE (Story Layout)
Standardize every lesson page into this structure:
1) Rohit asks question/confusion (short)
2) Priya explains in simple Hindi (clear blocks)
3) Real-world example highlight box
4) Quick Summary box
5) Mini quiz (3 questions)
6) Next/Previous buttons
Keep content, only restructure UI.

F) BLOG SEO & READABILITY
- Add auto Table of Contents
- Add reading time + updated date
- Add related articles at bottom
- Add FAQ section with schema markup
- Add internal links to relevant courses/tools

G) LIVE NEWS COPYRIGHT SAFE
- Show only headline + 1-2 line snippet
- Always show original source name + publish date
- Add "Read Full Article" button linking to original website
- Add disclaimer: "We show summaries; rights belong to publishers."

H) USER PROGRESS + DASHBOARD
- Add "My Learning" dashboard page
- Track lesson completion and progress % using localStorage
- Show completed lessons list and "Continue Learning"
- Add simple onboarding popup: "Choose your level: Beginner / Intermediate"

I) MOBILE OPTIMIZATION
- Ensure everything works on 360px width
- Increase readability on mobile
- Add hamburger menu
- Ensure buttons are thumb friendly

J) PRIYA & ROHIT CHARACTER SYSTEM
- Use flat minimal professional illustrations.
- Priya theme = green tone, professional office look.
- Rohit theme = modern stylish office look (shirt + blazer).
- Use these characters consistently:
  Homepage hero (both)
  Lesson pages (Priya explains, Rohit asks)
  Tools & calculators page (small character illustration)
  Blog pages (small illustration at top)
- Provide a clear folder structure for assets:
  /assets/characters/priya/
  /assets/characters/rohit/
  /assets/characters/icons/
- Use SVG or PNG.

Finally:
- Give me a summary of what changes you made
- Ensure no route/page is missing
- Ensure the redesign is consistent across the entire website
