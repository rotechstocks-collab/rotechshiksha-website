IMPORTANT RULE: Do NOT delete any page or route unless I explicitly say “permanently remove”.
I have two issues to fix urgently:

✅ Issue 1: On /beginner-course, Priya/Rohit avatars are not showing (blank or broken).
✅ Issue 2: Video page is giving 404 Page Not Found (URL currently: /educational-videos).

I need a clean, stable solution.

✅ 1) Fix Priya/Rohit Avatars on /beginner-course

Ensure all Priya/Rohit avatar images use ONLY this reusable component:

client/src/components/characters/CharacterAvatar.tsx

Avatar paths must be strictly:

Priya → /characters/avatars/priya.png

Rohit → /characters/avatars/rohit.png

Do NOT allow fallback initials (“P” / “R”).
The avatar must always display image.

✅ Steps:

Check /beginner-course page for avatar usage.

Replace any <img> or old avatar logic with:

<CharacterAvatar character="priya" size="md" />

<CharacterAvatar character="rohit" size="md" />

Ensure CSS does not hide the image:

must use: object-contain not object-cover

Add alt="Priya avatar" and alt="Rohit avatar"

Confirm avatars show correctly in desktop + mobile view.

✅ 2) Fix Video Page 404 (Create / Register Route)

I want a working Videos page at:
✅ /educational-videos

✅ Steps:

Create a new page component:
client/src/pages/EducationalVideos.tsx

Add this route properly in router:
/educational-videos → <EducationalVideos />

Ensure navbar link points to /educational-videos

Page should use Varsity-style clean layout:

Heading: “Educational Videos”

Subheading in Hinglish:
“Short, practical videos — beginners ke liye bilkul simple.”

Add 6 placeholder video cards (YouTube embed placeholder or thumbnail cards)

Each card must be:

bg-white border border-gray-200 rounded-2xl shadow-sm

include title + short Hinglish description

button: “Watch”

Optional:
If no real videos exist yet, add:
“Videos coming soon — abhi courses & tools explore karo ✅”

✅ 3) Verification (Must Do)

Verify:
✅ /beginner-course → Priya & Rohit avatars visible (no blank, no P/R text)
✅ /educational-videos → No 404, page loads properly
✅ Navbar link opens correct page

✅ OUTPUT REQUIRED
