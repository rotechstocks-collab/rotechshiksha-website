Polish and improve the existing FAQ page design and content for a Hindi stock market education website (Rotech Shiksha).

Target audience:
- Complete beginners
- Zero stock market knowledge
- Nervous and confused first-time learners

Goal:
- Increase trust
- Reduce fear
- Make beginners feel reassured
- Keep design clean and professional (Zerodha Varsity style)

DO NOT:
- Redesign the entire page
- Add flashy colors or animations
- Add too many CTAs

KEEP:
- Existing FAQ questions
- Simple accordion layout
- Clean white fintech style

IMPROVEMENTS REQUIRED:

1. Heading Improvement
Change main heading to:
"Stock Market Beginners ke Common Doubts"

Add a short subheading below it:
"Yeh wahi sawal hain jo har beginner ke mann me aate hain — bilkul natural."

2. Default Open FAQs
Keep the first 3 FAQs expanded by default:
- Kya stock market risky hai?
- Stock market shuru karne ke liye kitna paisa chahiye?
- Kya bilkul beginner stock market seekh sakta hai?

3. Answer Tone Polish
Rewrite answers in:
- Very simple Hindi
- Short paragraphs
- Reassuring and friendly tone
- Avoid technical jargon
- No promises of profit

Example tone:
"Yeh confusion hona bilkul normal hai..."
"Isliye hum pehle basics se shuru karte hain..."

4. Visual Spacing & Readability
- Increase vertical spacing between FAQ items
- Improve line height for mobile reading
- Keep font readable and calm
- Center content nicely on desktop
- Mobile-first layout

5. Soft Trust Line (Above CTA)
Add a soft reassurance line before CTA:
"Yeh platform sirf education ke liye hai — hum tips ya stock recommendations nahi dete."

6. CTA Section (Keep Minimal)
Keep only ONE CTA at the bottom:
Button text:
"Start Beginner Stock Market Course"

Add one supportive line above button:
"Rohit ne bhi yahin se shuruaat ki thi — aap bhi kar sakte ho."

7. Overall Feel
The page should feel:
- Calm
- Trustworthy
- Beginner-friendly
- Not salesy
- Not childish

End result:
A polished FAQ page that removes fear, builds confidence, and gently guides beginners toward learning.
