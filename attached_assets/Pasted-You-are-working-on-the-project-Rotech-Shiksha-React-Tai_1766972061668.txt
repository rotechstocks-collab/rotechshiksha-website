You are working on the project “Rotech Shiksha” (React + Tailwind + Vite).
We need to generate a PREMIUM Canva-style book PDF with branding + comic storytelling style using existing Priya & Rohit avatars, without deleting any pages/routes.

✅ GOAL

Create a complete “Book-style Premium PDF” generator inside the website like a Canva-designed book:

Cover page

Table of contents

Chapters with storytelling Hinglish language

Priya & Rohit comic callouts

Icons + illustrations (simple vector icons)

Consistent margin/grid system

Branding on every page

Book should look professional, premium, not child-like

✅ TASKS
1) Create a premium PDF book generator

Create / update PDF generation system:

Add emoji icons inside callouts.

Example:
Priya: “Simple hai Rohit, market ek dukaan jaisa hai...”
Rohit: “Par Priya, loss ho gaya toh kya?”

4) Add branding footer on each page

Footer:
“Rotech Shiksha • rotechshiksha.com • © 2025”
Include small Priya icon on left, Rohit icon on right.

5) Use existing avatars only

Use these images:
/assets/characters/priya_main.png
/assets/characters/rohit_main.png

Crop them as circle and place in book like Canva style.

6) Create a “Book Download Button”

Add a new section on homepage or Tools page:

Button: “Download Premium Stock Market Book”

On click → generatePremiumStockMarketBookPDF()

Circle gradients

Rounded rectangles
