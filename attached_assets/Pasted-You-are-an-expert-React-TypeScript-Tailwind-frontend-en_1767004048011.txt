Issue:

On Desktop at 100% zoom, after the Pricing section, content below is clipped / disappears on the Pricing page.

✅ Confirmed file: client/src/pages/PricingPage.tsx
Possible related wrappers: App.tsx, Layout.tsx, MainLayout.tsx

✅ TASK 1: Fix Clipping / Disappearing Content
Step A (Mandatory):

Audit PricingPage.tsx and global wrappers for:

overflow-hidden

h-screen, h-[100vh]

min-h-screen combined with overflow-hidden

max-h-*

absolute sections inside fixed-height parent

Step B:

Fix rules:

Never keep overflow-hidden on full-page wrappers. Replace with:

overflow-x-hidden OR remove completely.

Replace full-screen forced height:

Replace h-screen / h-[100vh] with min-h-[100svh]

or remove height constraints so content flows naturally.

If any section uses absolute, ensure parent has correct height and does NOT clip children.

Step C: Debug to identify exact culprit

Temporarily add:

outline outline-2 outline-red-500 on suspected wrappers to see which one is stopping after pricing.
Check computed height in DevTools:

which wrapper ends exactly at Pricing.

Expected result:

After Pricing section, all subsequent content must be visible on:

Desktop 100% zoom ✅

Desktop 125% zoom ✅

Mobile ✅

✅ TASK 2: Scroll Reset On Route Change

When user scrolls down and navigates via navbar, the new page must open from top.

If using Wouter (it is used in project):
Add this in App.tsx or root layout:

import { useEffect } from "react";
import { useLocation } from "wouter";

function ScrollToTop() {
  const [location] = useLocation();

  useEffect(() => {
    window.scrollTo({ top: 0, left: 0, behavior: "auto" });
  }, [location]);

  return null;
}

export default ScrollToTop;


Mount <ScrollToTop /> above routes.

✅ GUARDRAILS

Do NOT delete any page/route

Do NOT remove the top market ticker

SEBI-safe copy must remain (no investment tips/guarantees)

Priya & Rohit remain friends, same age (not siblings)

Keep pricing plan structure unchanged

✅ FINAL OUTPUT REQUIRED

Tell the exact root cause (file + class)

Show code changes (diff style)

Confirm issue fixed on Desktop 100% zoom + mobile

Confirm ticker still present and no route deleted

Now implement cleanly.
