You are working on an existing production website "Rotech Shiksha".

IMPORTANT:
Do NOT remove, rename, redesign, or simplify any existing working feature unless explicitly instructed.
The goal is RESTORATION + RELOCATION, not redesign.

---------------------------------------
TASK 1: RESTORE TOOLS SECTIONS INSIDE "MORE"
---------------------------------------

Earlier, the website had a "Tools" menu containing multiple useful sections.
These sections were removed or altered.

I want ALL previously available Tools features to be RESTORED exactly as they were
and placed inside the top navigation "More" dropdown menu.

Do NOT delete any tool.
Do NOT change their internal UI or logic.
Only move their navigation links under "More".

---------------------------------------
TASK 2: RESTORE "LIVE NEWS" (CRITICAL)
---------------------------------------

There was a "Live News" (also called Live Business News / Market News) option earlier inside Tools.

I want the SAME Live News page restored with the following EXACT behavior:

1. Live financial & stock market news is fetched automatically
   - Sources like Moneycontrol, Economic Times, Financial Express, Bloomberg, etc.
   - News must update in real-time or near real-time

2. News cards must show:
   - Image
   - Headline
   - Source name
   - Date & time

3. When user clicks on a news image or headline:
   - The ORIGINAL SOURCE PAGE must open
   - Example: clicking Moneycontrol news opens the Moneycontrol article page
   - Do NOT open a rewritten or internal summary page

4. Inside the SAME Live News page, add a TAB system:
   - Tab 1: News
   - Tab 2: Live Videos

5. Live Videos tab must:
   - Show live / latest business & market-related videos
   - Videos should be playable on the same page (embed if possible)
   - Sources can include YouTube channels or trusted finance publishers

6. Category filters must exist exactly like before:
   - All News
   - Markets
   - Economy
   - Business
   - Commodities
   - Banking
   - Mutual Funds
   (Keep structure clean and mobile-friendly)

7. Language toggle:
   - English / Hindi (if already implemented earlier, keep it)

8. Disclaimer must be visible:
   - "For educational purposes only. No buy/sell recommendations."

---------------------------------------
TASK 3: NAVIGATION PLACEMENT
---------------------------------------

Add navigation as follows:

Top Navbar → More dropdown → 
- Live News
- Market News (if separate earlier)
- All other previously existing Tools sections

Do NOT create duplicate pages.
Connect to existing routes if available.
If route was deleted, recreate it exactly as before.

---------------------------------------
TASK 4: DESIGN & UX RULES
---------------------------------------

- Keep existing UI style, spacing, fonts, and colors
- Mobile-first responsive layout
- No clutter
- No aggressive CTAs
- Educational, fintech-style (Zerodha Varsity inspired)

---------------------------------------
ABSOLUTE RULES (VERY IMPORTANT)
---------------------------------------

❌ Do NOT remove Tools functionality
❌ Do NOT replace live news with static or dummy data
❌ Do NOT summarize or rewrite external news
❌ Do NOT break external source linking
❌ Do NOT change working APIs unless broken

✅ Goal is to RESTORE the exact Live News + Live Video experience
   and place it under "More" menu.

After implementation:
- Verify that clicking a news card opens the original publisher page
- Verify live videos play correctly
- Verify navigation works on desktop and mobile
