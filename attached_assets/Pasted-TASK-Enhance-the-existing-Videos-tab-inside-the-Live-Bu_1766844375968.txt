TASK:
Enhance the existing "Videos" tab inside the Live Business News page.

GOAL:
Show daily stock market & business-related YouTube videos from trusted official news channels,
without changing existing UI, layout, navigation, routes, or styling.

STRICT RULES (VERY IMPORTANT):
- DO NOT modify header, footer, navigation, layout, spacing, or design
- DO NOT rename routes or URLs
- DO NOT remove or change existing News tab
- ONLY enhance the Videos tab logic and data
- Use YouTube official embed OR redirect-to-YouTube only (legal-safe)
- Do NOT download, rehost, or edit any video
- Keep everything mobile-first and lightweight

VIDEO SOURCES (OFFICIAL CHANNELS ONLY):
Fetch latest videos from:
- CNBC Awaaz (Hindi – Stock Market, Business)
- Zee Business (Hindi – Markets, Economy)
- CNBC TV18 (English – Markets, Economy)
- Bloomberg TV (English – Global markets)
- ET Now (English – Indian markets)
- Moneycontrol (Hindi + English)
- BQ Prime
- Any other verified stock market / business news channels

CONTENT FILTER:
- Only videos related to:
  - Stock Market
  - Share Market
  - Business News
  - Economy
  - Market Opening / Closing
  - Nifty / Sensex
- Exclude non-business or entertainment content

LANGUAGE SUPPORT:
Enable multi-language video discovery:
- Hindi
- English
- Gujarati
- Marathi
- Tamil
- Telugu
- Bengali
- Kannada
- Malayalam

LANGUAGE LOGIC:
- Detect video language from YouTube metadata if available
- If language not detected, infer from channel default language
- Add a small language tag badge (e.g., HI / EN / TA / GU)
- If selected language videos are unavailable, gracefully fallback to English

VIDEOS TAB UI BEHAVIOR:
Inside the existing Videos tab:
- Show video thumbnail
- Show video title
- Show channel name
- Show publish time (e.g., "3 hours ago")
- Add a clear CTA button: "Watch on YouTube"
- On click → open the original YouTube video or channel

UPDATE STRATEGY:
- Auto-refresh video list every few hours OR on page reload
- Cache results briefly to avoid excessive API calls

LEGAL DISCLAIMER (SMALL TEXT BELOW VIDEOS):
"All videos are embedded or linked from their official YouTube channels.
We do not own or upload this content."

PERFORMANCE:
- Lazy-load video embeds
- Load thumbnails first, iframe only on interaction
- Ensure fast load on mobile networks

FINAL CHECK:
- Existing page must look visually identical
- Only Videos tab becomes richer and more useful
- No copyright or policy violations
