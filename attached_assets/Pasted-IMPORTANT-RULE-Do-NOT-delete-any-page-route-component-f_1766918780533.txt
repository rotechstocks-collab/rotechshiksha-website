IMPORTANT RULE: Do NOT delete any page/route/component from my website unless I explicitly say “permanently remove this page”. You may reorganize or move pages, but do not delete anything.

I have uploaded a sprite sheet image at:
client/public/characters/sprite.png
It contains 8 characters in a 4 columns × 2 rows grid (Priya & Rohit poses).

TASK 1: Split + Trim the sprite sheet into 8 clean PNG files

Create a Node.js script (use sharp) inside scripts/splitCharacters.ts (or .js) that:

Reads client/public/characters/sprite.png

Splits it into 8 images (4 columns × 2 rows)

Automatically trims/crops extra empty transparent or solid background space from each image

Saves output into: client/public/characters/poses/

Name the output files exactly like this:

priya-point.png

priya-think.png

priya-clipboard.png

priya-smile.png

rohit-confused.png

rohit-thumb.png

rohit-idea.png

rohit-write.png

Also generate client/public/characters/poses/index.ts exporting these paths for easy import.

TASK 2: Create reusable Character Tip UI system (Zerodha Varsity style)

Create components:

client/src/components/characters/CharacterTip.tsx

accepts props: character: "priya" | "rohit", pose, title, message, actionLabel?, onAction?

renders a small card with:

avatar image (from poses)

short text (max 2 lines)

optional button for example

client/src/components/characters/CharacterChat.tsx

renders Priya + Rohit as short conversation (2–3 lines each)

should look clean and professional, not childish

TASK 3: Integrate Priya & Rohit in key pages (Do NOT remove pages)

Add these components carefully without breaking routing:

Homepage: show a hero chat where Rohit asks “Where should I start?” and Priya gives a roadmap answer + CTA buttons.

Learning/Roadmap page: show a CharacterTip at top introducing Beginner → Intermediate → Advanced path.

Calculator page: show PriyaTip explaining why the calculator is useful (risk control + position sizing).

TASK 4: Occasional Cartoon Comic Panel (Quiz/Story Popup)

Create a modal component: client/src/components/characters/ComicModal.tsx

This modal shows 2–3 comic panels (for now use placeholders with the same characters)

Add a “See Example” button in CharacterTip that opens this modal.

TASK 5: Make sure everything is responsive + fast

Lazy load large images

Use loading="lazy" for character images

Use proper alt text for SEO

Deliverables:

✅ scripts for split + trim
✅ character pose assets exported in index.ts
✅ CharacterTip + CharacterChat + ComicModal components
✅ Integrated into Homepage + Calculator + Roadmap pages
✅ No page deletion under any condition

After implementation, show me:

which files were created/changed

how to run the split script (command)

screenshots or explanation of how characters appear on pages
