Redesign the Home Page of the financial education website with a modern, creative, and animated look focused on stock market & financial education.
🎨 Visual & Animation Style:
•	Use cartoon-style creative illustrations related to:
o	Stock market learning
o	Investing basics
o	Financial growth
o	Charts, coins, graphs, people learning finance
•	Background should have subtle animated elements:
o	Moving graphs
o	Floating coins
o	Animated candlesticks
o	Soft motion shapes
•	Animations must be smooth, lightweight, and non-distracting
Use Lottie animations / SVG animations / CSS animations for best performance on Replit.
