You are a senior full-stack engineer and security auditor.

Project: Rotech Shiksha (React + TypeScript + Express + Postgres + Drizzle)
Goal: Make the project production-ready with security + performance + SEO improvements.

I want you to do a complete implementation plan and give COPY-PASTEABLE patches file-wise.

IMPORTANT RULES:
- Do NOT give generic explanations only.
- Give exact code changes with file path and line references.
- Every fix must include:
  (1) Why it’s needed
  (2) Exact code patch
  (3) What to test after applying
- Keep changes minimal and safe.

TASKS (PRIORITY ORDER):

✅ 1) SECURITY FIXES (MUST FIX)
A) Remove TEST_OTP fallback completely.
   - Find the code in server/routes.ts where otpValid becomes true using TEST_OTP ("123456")
   - Ensure production can NEVER accept test OTP.
   - Allow test OTP only if NODE_ENV !== "production" and mobile number matches a whitelist.

B) Fix session cookies:
   - secure: true only in production
   - httpOnly: true
   - sameSite: "strict"
   - Make SESSION_SECRET mandatory (no hardcoded fallback)
   - If SESSION_SECRET missing, throw a clear startup error.

C) Add rate limiting:
   - Apply express-rate-limit on OTP endpoints:
     POST /api/auth/send-otp
     POST /api/auth/verify-otp
     POST /api/auth/resend-otp
   - Limit: 5 requests per 15 minutes per IP.
   - Also add a general API limiter for other routes.

D) Add CORS config:
   - Only allow requests from my domain(s):
     https://rotechshiksha.com
     https://rotech-solutions--rotechstocks.replit.app
   - Allow credentials for session cookies.

E) Add security headers:
   - Add helmet
   - Add CSP (at least a basic CSP)
   - Add X-Content-Type-Options, X-Frame-Options, Referrer-Policy

✅ 2) FRONTEND STABILITY
A) Add a React ErrorBoundary:
   - Create a reusable ErrorBoundary component.
   - Wrap App router so UI does not show blank white screen on crash.
   - Show user-friendly message + reload button.

✅ 3) PERFORMANCE
A) Add route based code splitting:
   - Use React.lazy + Suspense for major pages.
   - Add a global loading skeleton.

B) Lazy load translation JSON files:
   - Load only selected language JSON instead of importing all 14 at once.

✅ 4) SEO
A) Add canonical URL support in SEOHead.tsx
B) Add JSON-LD structured data:
   - Course schema for course pages
   - Organization schema for homepage
C) Fix duplicate route issues if any (/videos vs /educational-videos)

OUTPUT FORMAT REQUIRED:

1) "Changes Summary" table: Fix | File | Risk | Estimated time
2) For each task: provide:
   - File Path
   - Old code block
   - New code block
   - Explanation
   - Testing steps
3) At the end: "Final Production Checklist" with exact steps to deploy safely.

Start with Task 1 (Security fixes) first and do not skip any.
