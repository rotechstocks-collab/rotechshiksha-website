"Fix my website layout + performance issues (React + Tailwind + ShadCN).

Goal: On desktop at 100% zoom, the Home and Pricing pages should look full, wide, and premium (not a small centered narrow block). Also improve initial load speed.

A) Desktop layout issue (Home hero looks too narrow):
In client/src/pages/Home.tsx, the hero section is visually narrow because of:

max-w-xl mx-auto on the main description paragraph

max-w-xl mx-auto on the stats grid

CTA container uses inline-block which keeps it small

✅ Fix:

Keep overall section container max width (max-w-6xl / max-w-7xl) BUT make hero content wide.

Convert hero into a responsive layout:

On desktop (lg+), use a 2-column grid: left = headline + description + CTA, right = character/story/chat/feature card (or stats).

Remove unnecessary max-w-xl limits on desktop (keep only on small screens if needed).

Make CTA area take full available width on desktop (remove inline-block constraint).

Ensure the design still looks good on mobile.

B) Dark mode invisible content:
Scan Home + Pricing + major reusable components and replace hardcoded colors like:
text-slate-600, text-gray-800, bg-white, border-gray-200
with theme-safe tokens:
text-foreground, text-muted-foreground, bg-background, bg-card, border-border
or proper dark: variants wherever necessary.

C) Improve load speed (very important):

Lazy-load heavy components on initial load:

MarketTicker (top live bar)

LiveChat / WhatsApp widgets (if present)
Use React.lazy + Suspense OR a simple delayed mount (e.g., render after 1200ms) so first paint is fast.

Add a lightweight skeleton/placeholder while loading these components.

Make sure repeated data fetch does not block UI; keep fetch async and non-blocking.

IMPORTANT RULES:

Do NOT remove any existing pages/routes/buttons/navigation labels.

Do NOT delete: Home, Courses, Learning Path, Tools, Blog, News, Pricing.

Keep all CTA buttons functional (Start Level 1 Free, Explore Tools etc).

After changes, verify: desktop 1366px+ at 100% zoom, and dark mode readability.

Deliverables:

Exact file changes with clear summary: what changed and why.

Confirm that no button/page was removed, only layout + theme + lazy loading improvements were done."
