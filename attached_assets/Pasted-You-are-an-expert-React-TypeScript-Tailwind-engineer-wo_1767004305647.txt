🔥 CRITICAL BUG

On Desktop at 100% zoom, after the <PricingPlans /> section in
client/src/pages/PricingPage.tsx, the content below is getting clipped/disappears.

✅ PricingPage.tsx itself has no full-page overflow or height constraints, so the issue is caused by:

client/src/components/PricingPlans.tsx (or the file exporting PricingPlans)
OR

Global wrapper (client/src/App.tsx, Layout.tsx, MainLayout.tsx, etc.)

✅ SUPER IMPORTANT (MANDATORY WORKFLOW)

Before editing anything:

Open the file exporting PricingPlans (@/components/PricingPlans).

Paste the top-level wrapper of PricingPlans (return JSX root container + its className) in the chat/notes.

Then proceed to apply the fix based on what you find.

✅ Reason: Bug is almost always due to a wrapper like h-screen, overflow-hidden, or absolute inside PricingPlans.

✅ TASK 1 — FIND ROOT CAUSE (MUST DO)
Step A: Inspect PricingPlans Component

Search in PricingPlans file for:

overflow-hidden

h-screen, h-[100vh]

min-h-screen combined with overflow-hidden

max-h-*

absolute, fixed, sticky

transform, filter, backdrop-blur (creates stacking context)

any wrapper like:

<section className="h-screen overflow-hidden">


✅ Identify the exact wrapper/class causing clipping.

Step B: Inspect Global App/Layout Wrapper

Check:

client/src/App.tsx

Layout wrapper around <Router /> / <Routes />

Search for:

overflow-hidden

h-screen

height: 100vh

position: fixed

min-h-screen overflow-hidden

✅ If found, remove vertical overflow clipping from full-page wrappers.

✅ TASK 2 — FIX CLIPPING PROPERLY (NO RANDOM CHANGES)
Fix Rules:

✅ Rule 1: Never use overflow-hidden on page-level/container wrapper.

Replace with:

overflow-x-hidden

OR remove it completely

✅ Rule 2: Replace forced viewport heights:
❌ h-screen, h-[100vh]
✅ with:

min-h-[100svh]

or no fixed height (preferred, so content can grow naturally)

✅ Rule 3: If any section uses absolute/fixed, ensure:

parent has relative

parent has natural height (padding/margin)

no clipping due to overflow constraints

✅ After fix, content below PricingPlans must be visible on:

Desktop 100% zoom ✅

Desktop 125% zoom ✅

Mobile ✅

✅ TASK 3 — DEBUG VALIDATION (MANDATORY)

Temporarily add:

outline outline-2 outline-red-500 on suspected wrappers

Use DevTools to confirm:

which wrapper ends at PricingPlans

which wrapper has height restrictions / overflow clipping

DOM exists but hidden due to clipping

Remove debug outlines after confirming.

✅ OUTPUT REQUIRED

Show the exact root cause (file + className wrapper)

Provide code diff (before/after)

Confirm content visible at:

Desktop 100% ✅

Desktop 125% ✅

Mobile ✅

Confirm:

No pages/routes deleted

Top market ticker remains

SEBI-safe copy unchanged

✅ GUARDRAILS (STRICT)

Do NOT delete any page/route

Do NOT remove top market ticker

Do NOT change pricing plan structure

Copy remains SEBI-safe (no investment tips/guarantees)
