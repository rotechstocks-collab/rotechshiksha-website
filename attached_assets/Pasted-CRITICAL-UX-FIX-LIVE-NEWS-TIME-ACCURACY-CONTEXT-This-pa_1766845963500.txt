CRITICAL UX FIX – LIVE NEWS TIME ACCURACY

CONTEXT:
This page is titled "Live Business News".
Showing "12h ago / 15h ago" creates a wrong impression that news is outdated.
We must ensure users only see near-real-time news.

=====================================
PRIMARY GOAL
=====================================

Only show news that is RECENT and feels LIVE.
User should NEVER see news older than 10–15 minutes on initial view.

=====================================
REQUIRED CHANGES
=====================================

1. STRICT TIME FILTER (MANDATORY)
- Filter news at fetch level.
- Only include news where:
  (currentTime - publishedAt) ≤ 15 minutes
- If news is older than 15 minutes:
  → Do NOT show it in the main feed.

2. TIME FORMAT RULE (MINUTES ONLY)
- Display time strictly in minutes:
  - "Just now" (0–1 min)
  - "2 mins ago"
  - "5 mins ago"
  - "10 mins ago"
- NEVER display:
  ❌ hours
  ❌ days
  ❌ dates

3. AUTO REFRESH LOGIC
- Refresh news automatically every 60 seconds.
- Always re-calculate time from publishedAt.
- Prevent stale data from staying on screen.

4. FALLBACK BEHAVIOR (VERY IMPORTANT)
- If no news is available within 15 minutes:
  - Show a neutral message:
    "Fetching latest live updates…"
  - Retry silently in background.
  - Do NOT fallback to older news.

5. OPTIONAL SECONDARY FEED (IF NEEDED)
- If required, older news (15+ mins) may go into:
  "Earlier Updates" section
- This section should be:
  - Visually separated
  - Clearly labeled
  - Not part of main live feed

=====================================
STRICT RULES
=====================================

- Do NOT fake timestamps.
- Do NOT convert hours into minutes artificially.
- Do NOT mislead users.
- Do NOT change page layout, routes, or styling.
- Keep disclaimer unchanged.

=====================================
FINAL RESULT EXPECTED
=====================================

When a user opens the page:
✔ They only see news from last 5–15 minutes  
✔ Time always shows in minutes  
✔ Page truly feels LIVE and trustworthy  
✔ No negative impression of outdated data
