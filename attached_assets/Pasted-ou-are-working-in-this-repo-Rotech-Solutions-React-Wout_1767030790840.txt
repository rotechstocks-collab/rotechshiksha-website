ou are working in this repo: Rotech-Solutions (React + Wouter + Tailwind + Radix).
DO NOT delete any route/page/component and DO NOT remove MarketTicker. Minimal, stable, reversible changes only.

CURRENT STATUS:
- Header offset measurement exists in client/src/App.tsx (useHeaderOffset), sets CSS var --app-header-offset.
- Header uses fixed positioning with top: var(--ticker-height).
- Scroll lock clearing exists in client/src/lib/scrollLock.ts and is called on route change, visibilitychange, and Escape.
Scroll freeze is NOT happening now. Focus on remaining layout/zoom banding.

MAIN TASK (critical):
1) Fix remaining zoom/top clipping/white-band feel by ensuring ALL top-of-page content is under the header offset.
   - GlobalStoryStrip is currently rendered outside <main>, right after <Header />.
   - Move <GlobalStoryStrip /> INSIDE <main> at the top (first child), so it receives padding-top via <main style={{ paddingTop: var(--app-header-offset) }}>.
   - Do NOT change its UI; just relocate so it’s not hidden behind fixed header.

2) Verify header offset logic is correct:
   - It must measure #app-header + [data-market-ticker], update --app-header-offset.
   - Keep fallback 120px if computed height is 0.
   - Ensure no parent containers have overflow:hidden that can clip content; keep min-h-[100svh] on the layout wrapper.

3) Fix dark theme banding ONLY if still visible after step 1:
   - Ensure Home + Pricing hero backgrounds use theme-safe classes (bg-background / gradients that work in dark).
   - Remove any remaining hard-coded light backgrounds in dark mode.

4) Clean-up:
   - Ensure no console spam/debug logs were introduced.
   - No MutationObserver loops/interval hacks.
   - No new warnings/errors.

DELIVERABLES:
- Show exact diffs for the changed files (likely client/src/App.tsx only; maybe a hero section file if needed).
- Explain briefly why moving GlobalStoryStrip fixes the top band/clipping at 90/100/125 zoom.
- Verify in Chrome desktop at 90/100/125 zoom on Home + Pricing + route switching; scroll must remain normal.
