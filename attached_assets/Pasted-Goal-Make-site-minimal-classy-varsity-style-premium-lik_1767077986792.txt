Goal: Make site minimal + classy varsity style, premium like Zerodha/Smallcase. Fix navbar density, mobile responsiveness, WhatsApp popup overlapping, global extra spacing, footer/disclaimer duplication, and bottom nav polish.

✅ 1) Global Spacing Fix (All Pages)

Audit all pages/components for excessive padding/margins, especially pt-20, py-16, min-h-screen, h-screen.

Replace heavy hero padding with responsive values:

Desktop: pt-16 py-12

Mobile: pt-12 py-8

Ensure no hero section uses min-h-screen unless intentional.

Create a reusable class page-section that uses:

py-10 md:py-14

px-4

Ensure headers don’t create huge blank space above titles.

✅ 2) Navbar Redesign (Premium + Slim)

Make navbar visually slimmer and less crowded:

reduce padding (horizontal + vertical)

reduce gap between nav links

reduce logo container width

Keep navbar height around 56px on desktop and 52px on mobile.

Reduce search bar prominence:

On Home page remove full search bar; show only a search icon.

On Blog/Tools pages show search bar below hero OR inside a modal drawer.

Make navbar responsive:

On mobile: show logo + hamburger + icons only (no long menu)

Move nav links to a drawer menu

Ensure login button never hides:

On mobile show login as icon button OR “Login” pill in drawer.

✅ 3) Login Button Rename + Premium Style

Rename “Login” to one of these options:

“Sign in”

“Account”

“Get Started”

Use subtle premium styling:

rounded-full

border + hover shadow

avoid loud colors

On mobile make it icon-only to save space.

✅ 4) WhatsApp Widget Fix (Mobile Friendly)

WhatsApp popup should NOT cover content.

On mobile:

default state should be minimized (only floating WhatsApp icon)

popup should open only when user taps icon

popup should open as bottom sheet / modal with max-height: 65vh

Ensure z-index stacking is correct:

popup should not overlap navbar

should not overlap bottom nav

Add responsive offsets:

bottom: above bottom nav

right: padded from edge

✅ 5) Footer + Disclaimer Redesign (Remove Double Disclaimer)

Currently disclaimer appears twice (one yellow/alert + one footer card). Remove duplication.

Keep only ONE disclaimer in footer.

Make disclaimer minimal + premium:

small text

subtle background

collapsible “Read more”

not too tall

Footer layout on mobile:

collapse sections into accordion

spacing tighter

remove extra blank space at bottom

keep copyright + “Made with care” small

✅ 6) Bottom Mobile Navigation Polish

Bottom nav should look premium like modern fintech apps:

semi-transparent blur background

thin border top

small icon + label

strong active state with pill highlight

Ensure it never overlaps page content:

add pb-20 in page wrapper globally for mobile only

✅ 7) Apply Varsity Minimal Theme Consistency

Use a consistent font scale:

headings bold but not oversized on mobile

body text slightly tighter

Use neutral backgrounds with subtle gradient only in hero

Buttons: consistent radius, hover effect, and spacing

Deliverable: update the codebase with these improvements and ensure all pages (Home, Blog, Pricing, FAQ, Courses, Tools) feel consistent, premium, and work perfectly on mobile.
