CRITICAL FIX: Live Business News → Videos Tab UX & Reliability

====================================
PROBLEM STATEMENT
====================================

Currently, many videos show:
- "This video is unavailable"
- Grey broken thumbnails
- Some videos play, many don’t

This creates:
❌ Broken experience
❌ Low trust
❌ Bad first impression

We must ensure:
✔ Only playable videos are shown
✔ Page always looks clean & premium
✔ Zero broken embeds visible to users

====================================
PRIMARY GOALS
====================================

1. NEVER show broken or unavailable videos
2. Show only VERIFIED, PLAYABLE YouTube videos
3. Improve video section UI to look professional
4. If a video can’t play → handle it gracefully (no errors)

====================================
TECHNICAL FIXES (MANDATORY)
====================================

1. VIDEO VALIDATION BEFORE RENDERING
- Before displaying any video:
  - Validate YouTube videoId
  - Check:
    ✔ embeddable = true
    ✔ regionRestriction does not block IN
    ✔ status = public
- If validation fails → DO NOT RENDER that video

2. FAIL-SAFE FALLBACK STRATEGY
- If embed fails at runtime:
  - Remove the iframe immediately
  - Replace with:
    ✔ Channel logo
    ✔ Video title
    ✔ “Watch on YouTube” button
- Never show:
  ❌ "This video is unavailable"
  ❌ Broken iframe UI

3. SOURCE PRIORITY (STABLE CHANNELS ONLY)
Prefer these official channels ONLY:
- CNBC Awaaz
- Zee Business
- ET Now
- Bloomberg Quint
- Moneycontrol
- NDTV Profit
- BQ Prime

Avoid:
- Shorts
- Private streams
- Scheduled videos
- Region-blocked live streams

====================================
UX & DESIGN IMPROVEMENTS
====================================

4. VIDEO CARD DESIGN (CLEAN & TRUSTED)
Each video card should show:
- Channel logo + verified badge
- Language badge (EN / HI / GU / MR / TA)
- LIVE badge only if actually live
- Clear "Watch on YouTube" CTA

5. NO AUTO-EMBED PLAY
- Do NOT autoplay videos inside the site
- Use:
  → Thumbnail preview
  → Click opens YouTube in new tab
This avoids embed failures completely.

6. LOADING & EMPTY STATES
- While loading:
  → Skeleton cards (video placeholder shimmer)
- If no valid videos found:
  → Show message:
    "Latest business videos are loading…"

====================================
LANGUAGE & CONTENT RULES
====================================

- Support multiple languages:
  English, Hindi, Gujarati, Marathi, Tamil
- Detect video language via metadata or channel
- Filter videos to business / stock market topics only

====================================
STRICT RULES
====================================

- DO NOT change routing or navigation
- DO NOT embed unstable live streams
- DO NOT show broken UI at any cost
- Reliability > Quantity (less videos is fine)

====================================
FINAL EXPECTED RESULT
====================================

✔ Every visible video is playable
✔ No grey boxes / unavailable errors
✔ Clean, premium, news-platform-like UI
✔ Users trust the Videos tab
✔ Looks professional even if YouTube API fails
