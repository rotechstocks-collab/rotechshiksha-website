You are a senior UI/UX designer + conversion copywriter + Next.js Tailwind developer.
Task: Upgrade the Mobile UI & Conversion flow of rotechshiksha.com homepage and learning path page to look PREMIUM like top Indian edtech websites (Groww, Zerodha Varsity style), while keeping current design structure.
Constraints:
Do NOT delete any page/route.
Keep the top market ticker always visible.
Hinglish tone.
Priya and Rohit are professional friends (same age), not siblings. means no "bro", no "bhaiya".
Priya avatar in green blazer, Rohit avatar in navy blazer.
Goals:
Make WhatsApp widget + button premium & non-intrusive.
Increase PDF signup conversions.
Increase course start conversions.
Reduce mobile UI clutter.
Implement these improvements exactly:
A) WhatsApp Floating Button + Widget:
On mobile, ensure WhatsApp floating button never overlaps bottom navigation bar.
Add bottom offset = 80px on mobile.
Button size slightly smaller.
When widget is opened, show a subtle dim/blur overlay background.
Add microcopy in widget footer: “No spam. Sirf learning support.”
Keep “Priya (Verified)” header.
Add greeting text: “Hi 👋 Main Priya ❤️ Tumhari stock market guide.”
Widget options should be:
Get Free Book (Premium PDF Guide)
Course Details (8 Level Learning Path)
Join Community (10,000+ members)
Share PDF (Invite friends)
B) “After This Course…” section: Replace generic benefits with more specific transformation cards: Card 1: “Market ko 10x easily samjhoge” Subtitle: “Candlestick, trend, support/resistance — beginner friendly.” Card 2: “Fake tips se safe rahoge” Subtitle: “Risk control + common scams se bachna seekhoge.” Card 3: “Paper trading se confidence build hoga” Subtitle: “Real market practice bina loss ke.”
C) Learning Path page improvements:
Above “Continue Level 1” button add a trust proof row:
⭐ 4.8 rating
👥 10,000+ learners
💬 2,000+ WhatsApp community
Add small text below Level 1 button: “Is level ke baad tum market ki basic language samjh jaoge.”
D) FAQ section improvements: Add conversion-friendly FAQs:
“Kya main 0 knowledge se start kar sakta hoon?”
“Kya ye Zerodha/Groww jaisa app hai?”
“Kya aap investment advice doge?”
“Mujhe kitne din me result dikhne lagega?”
“Isme examples real market wale hain?”
E) Styling upgrades:
Use softer shadows, better spacing, and consistent rounded corners.
CTA buttons should feel premium (slight gradient or border glow).
Maintain current theme colors.
Deliverable:
Provide updated Next.js + Tailwind code changes.
Update relevant components only (WhatsAppWidget component, Benefits section, LearningPath page section, FAQ data).
Ensure mobile-first responsiveness.
