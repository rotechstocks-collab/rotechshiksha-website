IMPORTANT RULE: Do NOT delete any page or route unless I explicitly say “permanently remove”.
I want to upgrade my entire site into a premium Zerodha Varsity / Smallcase inspired education platform, but with my own branding, copy, and assets (Priya/Rohit).
Focus on: soft UI, clean cards, consistent typography, better UX, SEO, and lead capture funnel.

✅ A) HERO SECTION — Elite spacing + typography

On Homepage:

Increase hero padding: py-14 md:py-20

Heading: text-4xl md:text-5xl font-bold leading-tight

Subheading: max-w-xl mx-auto text-base md:text-lg text-slate-600 leading-relaxed

Add mb-4 spacing under heading, mt-4 for CTA section

✅ B) HERO CTA CARD — Premium polish

Improve hero CTA card:

bg-white border border-slate-200 rounded-2xl shadow-sm

padding: p-6 md:p-8

Buttons: consistent spacing gap-3 mt-4

Add trust badges below buttons:

✅ No Signup Required

✅ Education Only

✅ Beginner Friendly
Use small pills: text-xs bg-slate-100 px-3 py-1 rounded-full

✅ C) PRIYA & ROHIT — Professional companion section

Under hero:

Add heading: “Meet your learning companions”

Subtext: “Priya explains, Rohit asks doubts you might have”

Ensure CharacterAvatar is used, perfectly circular, consistent shadow/border

✅ D) LEAD CAPTURE FUNNEL (High priority)

Add a section below hero CTA:

Title: “Free PDF: Stock Market Beginner Checklist”

Subtitle: “Simple Hinglish + actionable steps”

Input: Email or WhatsApp number

Button: “Send me Free PDF”

Small note: “No spam. Only learning updates.”

Implementation:

Store leads in localStorage temporarily

If backend exists, create API endpoint /api/leads to store leads in DB

✅ E) HOMEPAGE MODULE GRID (Varsity-style)

Add “Explore Learning” section like Varsity:
Create 5 clean soft cards:

Courses

Learning Path

Tools

Market Gyaan (Blog)

News

Each card:

bg-white border border-gray-200 rounded-2xl shadow-sm

Pastel badge inside icon area only

Short subtext under title

Hover: shadow + slight lift

✅ F) LEARNING PATH HIGHLIGHT (Homepage)

Add “Your Learning Roadmap” section:

Step 1: Basics

Step 2: Practice with Tools

Step 3: Advanced & Strategies
Show as 3 cards with icons + short Hinglish text.

✅ G) TOOLS SECTION IMPROVE

Make tools/cards consistent:

White cards

subtle icons

2 line description max

show “Most Used Tools”

add CTA: “Explore all tools”

✅ H) BLOG SECTION (Market Gyaan)

Improve blog listing UI:

clean grid layout

consistent typography

show category tag

show read time

keep card design consistent

✅ I) SEO + TRUST UPGRADES

Add these improvements:

Add FAQ section on homepage with 6 questions in Hinglish

Add FAQ schema (JSON-LD) in homepage head

Ensure meta title + description are optimized for:
“Stock market course in Hindi”
“Stock market learning for beginners”

Add internal linking:
Homepage → Beginner Course → Tools → Blog

Add Breadcrumb schema on course/tool pages if possible

Add a disclaimer (simple):
