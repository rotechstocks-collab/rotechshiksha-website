IMPORTANT RULE: Do NOT delete any page or route unless I explicitly say “permanently remove”.
Keep the top Market Ticker bar. Do NOT remove it. You may improve it.
My goal is to upgrade my website into a Zerodha Varsity–style premium UI with soft colors, clean typography, and consistent spacing — while keeping Hinglish tone.

✅ 1) Global Varsity Design System (Typography + Spacing + Soft UI)

Create / update global style tokens so every page feels consistent:

Typography

Use Inter as primary font (fallback system font).

Add consistent heading + body scale:

h1: text-4xl md:text-5xl font-semibold tracking-tight

h2: text-2xl md:text-3xl font-semibold

body: text-base md:text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed

Layout utilities

Add .page-container = max-w-6xl mx-auto px-4

Add .section = py-12 md:py-16

Cards

Add .card-soft = rounded-2xl border border-gray-200 bg-white shadow-sm hover:shadow-md transition

Buttons

Primary: rounded-xl, slightly thick, no harsh gradient

Secondary: outline style

Background

use bg-gray-50 / bg-slate-50 as the primary page background

Apply these styles across the site so UI looks premium and minimal like Varsity.

✅ 2) Home Page Varsity Blueprint Upgrade (/)

Update Home page layout to the following structure:

(A) Hero Section (2-column, Varsity-style)

Left:

Big headline: “Stock Market Seekho — Bilkul Zero Se”

Hinglish subheading (short, trustable)

“FREE Course Shuru Karo” (primary)

“Tools Dekho” (secondary)

Under CTA: trust badge row:
