IMPORTANT RULE: Do NOT delete any page or route unless I explicitly say “permanently remove”.
I want to upgrade my Videos page into a premium Zerodha Varsity-style Video Hub (like a learning platform), using only legal YouTube embeds (no downloading, no rehosting).

My target route:
✅ /educational-videos

✅ 1) Page Design (Varsity Style)

Build a clean premium page:

Background: #f7f9fc

Container: max-w-6xl mx-auto px-4 py-12

Heading: “Educational Videos”

Subheading in Hinglish:
“YouTube pe available best stock market videos — beginners ke liye bilkul simple.”

Use clean card layout:

bg-white border border-gray-200 rounded-2xl shadow-sm

Hover: shadow-md -translate-y-0.5

✅ 2) Data Source (Legal Only)

Create a JSON file for video content:

client/src/data/videos.ts

Each video object must include:

id (unique)

title (Hinglish)

description

youtubeId

channelName

category (Basics, Trading, Investing, IPO, Mutual Funds, Psychology, Technical Analysis)

playlistName (optional)

duration (optional)

level (“Beginner” | “Intermediate” | “Advanced”)

Videos must be shown ONLY via:
✅ YouTube iframe embed
✅ thumbnail preview
✅ “Watch on YouTube” link

✅ 3) Categories + Filter System

At top of page add:
✅ Category chips (Basics, Trading, Investing, IPO, Mutual Funds, Psychology, Technical)
✅ Level filter dropdown (Beginner / Intermediate / Advanced)
✅ Search input (search title + description)
✅ Sort dropdown (Most Popular / Newest / Duration)

UX must be smooth and responsive.

✅ 4) Playlist-style Layout (Varsity Feel)

Show content in 2-level structure:

✅ Left sidebar (or top on mobile):

Playlist list (Beginner Series, Trading Series, Investing Series, etc.)

✅ Main content area:

Videos in selected playlist displayed as cards

Each card shows:

thumbnail

title

small channel name

category tag badge

duration badge

“Watch” button

Clicking video opens an embed player on the top (or in modal) and plays it.

✅ 5) “Continue Watching” Section (Important)

Build a Continue Watching feature:

Track last watched videoId + timestamp

Save progress in localStorage

On page load:
✅ show “Continue Watching” card at top if data exists

Button: “Resume”

Also create:
✅ Watch History list (last 10 watched videos)

✅ 6) Priya & Rohit Helper Tip (Optional)

Add a small tip card under heading:

Priya explains:
“Videos ke saath course bhi follow karo to clarity fast milegi ✅”

Use:
<CharacterAvatar character="priya" size="sm" />
