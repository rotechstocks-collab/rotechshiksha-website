You are improving an existing React + Tailwind website (Rotech Shiksha).
Do NOT delete any pages/routes/components. Only enhance design and fix alignment issues.
Goal: Make the “PDF Download Thankyou + WhatsApp Support” section look premium like Canva/fintech style.

✅ REQUIREMENTS:

1) Fix Right Side Drift / Layout Overflow Globally

Check for horizontal overflow in all layouts.

Add global CSS:

html, body { overflow-x: hidden; width: 100%; }

Ensure all main containers use max-w-[1200px] mx-auto px-4

Identify any element using fixed width causing drift and replace with responsive values.

2) Premium Thankyou Section UI (most important)

Locate the page/section where it shows:
“Dhanyavaad! Tumhara PDF ready hai. Abhi download karo!” and the button Download PDF

Replace with premium design:

Background: soft gradient card (very light green → white)

Add subtle pattern/blur circle decoration behind card

Add a top badge:
✅ “Premium PDF Ready”

Add Priya + Rohit mini avatars on top right corner of card

Improve typography:

Heading: bold + 2xl

Subheading: muted small text

Button:

Big primary button, rounded-full, shadow-lg

Hover glow + slight scale

Icon on button: download icon

Add below the button:
✅ “100% Free | No Spam | Instant Access”

Add “Next Step” section inside same card:

Text: “Next: Start Level 1 Free Course →”

A secondary button: “Start Level 1”

This should route to existing learning path/courses page.

3) Replace “PDF mein kya hai?” bullets with Premium Feature Chips

Convert the bullet list into:

2-column grid

Each item inside a rounded chip/card with icon + short text
Example:
✅ 5 Steps to Start Investing
✅ Common Mistakes to Avoid
✅ Glossary + Tools
✅ Weekly Plan

Add social proof line:
⭐ “10,000+ learners already downloaded this PDF”

4) Upgrade WhatsApp Support Widget UI

Improve WhatsApp widget (“Chat with Priya”):

Add Priya avatar at top-left with a green verified badge

Title: “Priya (Verified Rotech Support)”

Subtitle: “Reply within 1 minute ❤️”

Buttons should look like premium cards:

left icon + title + subtitle

Add 1 more button:
✅ “Share PDF on WhatsApp”

Add a mini trust note at bottom:
“Your number is safe. No spam.”

5) Animations (Premium, subtle)

Card fade-in on scroll

Button hover pop effect

WhatsApp widget open animation smooth

✅ Output required:

List all files changed

Mention the exact components updated
