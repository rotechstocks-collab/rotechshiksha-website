You are working on a React + TS + Tailwind site (rotechshiksha). The header is fixed and already uses dynamic CSS var --app-header-offset set in App.tsx, and main uses pt-[var(--app-header-offset)].

Problem: On multiple pages (Home and Pricing), there is still a huge blank gap/whitespace under the header. It looks like the hero sections are vertically centered or have excessive top padding, so content starts far below the header even though the header-offset is correct.

Task:
1) Inspect these files and any layout wrappers they use:
   - client/src/pages/Home.tsx
   - client/src/pages/PricingPage.tsx (and any components used inside)
   - Any shared page wrapper component if exists.

2) Find and remove/adjust causes of excessive whitespace such as:
   - min-h-screen / h-screen / min-h-[100vh] / min-h-[100svh]
   - flex + items-center + justify-center causing vertical centering
   - large padding classes like py-24/py-32/pt-24/mt-24 that push content down
   - extra top padding added again on top of the global main padding-top.

3) Fix layout so that:
   - The FIRST visible section of each page starts immediately below the fixed header with only a small intentional spacing (e.g., 12–24px).
   - Pages should be top-aligned, NOT vertically centered.
   - Maintain responsive design: add a modest top spacing like `pt-6 md:pt-10` inside the page container, NOT huge values.
   - Do not remove the market ticker. Do not delete any route/page.

4) Implementation guidance (use this approach):
   - On page root container, use `min-h-[calc(100vh-var(--app-header-offset))]` ONLY if needed, but DO NOT center vertically.
   - Prefer:
       `className="w-full pt-6 md:pt-10 pb-16"`
     and for sections:
       `className="max-w-6xl mx-auto px-4"`
   - If the page currently has `flex items-center justify-center`, change to:
       `flex flex-col items-start justify-start`
     or remove flex centering entirely.

5) Verification checklist:
   - Test at zoom 90%, 100%, 125% in desktop.
   - Home: hero heading should appear right under header (small gap).
   - Pricing: “Apna Plan Choose Karo” heading should also start right under header (small gap).
   - No overlap under header, no huge white blank space.

6) Output:
   - Provide exact code diff edits for Home.tsx and PricingPage.tsx (and any wrapper you modify).
   - Keep everything else unchanged.
