Issue: On Desktop at 100% zoom, after the Pricing section, the content below is not visible / clipped / disappears.

✅ GOAL

Fix the layout so:

No content clips after Pricing

Works on Desktop (100%, 125% zoom), Mobile, Tablet

No pages/routes deleted

Top market ticker must remain (do not remove)

SEBI-safe copy remains (no investment tips/guarantees)

✅ BUG DESCRIPTION (Critical)

After Pricing section, next sections exist in DOM but become invisible due to:

overflow-hidden applied on parent containers

h-screen, h-[100vh], fixed height wrappers

misused min-h-screen combined with overflow-hidden

layout collapse due to absolute positioning

incorrect z-index stacking context clipping sections below

✅ STEP-BY-STEP FIX INSTRUCTIONS
1) Locate the Exact Cause (Must Do)

Audit these files (and related wrappers):

Home.tsx

Layout.tsx / App.tsx

Hero.tsx

Pricing.tsx

Any MainLayout, PageWrapper, or SectionWrapper

Search for these classes and patterns:

overflow-hidden

h-screen

h-[100vh]

min-h-screen

fixed, absolute, sticky

relative with overflow-hidden

transform, filter, backdrop-blur (creates stacking context)

max-h-*

grid with h-screen

wrappers like min-h-screen overflow-hidden

✅ Identify the exact container that is causing clipping after Pricing.

2) Fix Rules (Do Not Guess Randomly)

Apply these safe fixes:

✅ Rule A: Never use overflow-hidden on full-page wrapper

If needed, replace with:

overflow-x-hidden (only horizontal protection)

OR overflow-visible for vertical flow

✅ Rule B: Avoid forced height containers
Replace:

h-screen, h-[100vh]
With:

min-h-[100svh]

OR remove fixed height completely if content should scroll naturally

✅ Rule C: Ensure every section naturally expands
Each section should be like:

py-12 md:py-20

no h-screen unless it’s truly full-screen

no wrapper that limits height

✅ Rule D: Fix absolute positioning
If Pricing or Hero is absolute, ensure parent has correct height:

Prefer not to use absolute for large sections

If required, parent must have:

relative

and correct padding/margin so next sections start below properly

✅ Rule E: Fix stacking context clipping
If you see a wrapper like:

relative overflow-hidden

transform + overflow-hidden
This can clip below content.
Solution:

remove overflow-hidden

remove unnecessary transform

apply overflow-x-hidden only

3) Must Add Quick Debug Validation (Do This Before Finalizing)

Temporarily add this debug border to confirm where clipping happens:

Add outline outline-2 outline-red-500 on suspected wrappers
Find which wrapper ends exactly after Pricing.

Also inspect in Chrome DevTools:

check computed height of main wrapper

check if main has height: 100vh

check if sections below exist but hidden due to overflow clipping

✅ REQUIRED FINAL OUTPUT

When you implement:

Tell me the exact root cause (which file + class)

Show final code changes as diff

Confirm it works on:

Desktop 100% zoom ✅

Desktop 125% zoom ✅

Mobile ✅

Ensure no page deleted, top ticker still present ✅

✅ VERY IMPORTANT GUARDRAILS

DO NOT delete any route/page

DO NOT remove top market ticker

Do NOT change Pricing plan structure

Keep Priya (green blazer expert) & Rohit (navy blazer learner) as friends (same age, not siblings)

Copy remains SEBI-safe

Now implement these changes cleanly.
