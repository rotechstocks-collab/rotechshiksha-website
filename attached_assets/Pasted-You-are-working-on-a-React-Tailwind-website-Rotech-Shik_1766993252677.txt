You are working on a React + Tailwind website (Rotech Shiksha).
IMPORTANT RULE: Do NOT delete any pages/routes. Only improve styling + fix layout bugs.

GOAL (Make Everything Premium)

Fix right-side drift / horizontal overflow globally (content should never cut off).

Improve global font scaling and typography system (mobile & desktop).

Replace all Priya/Rohit avatar images everywhere with transparent main versions (consistent).

Make the PDF Thankyou section + WhatsApp widget premium (Canva/Notion style).

Keep everything responsive (mobile-first).

✅ TASK 1: FIX RIGHT-SIDE DRIFT (GLOBAL)

Find any element causing horizontal overflow.

Add global CSS:

html, body { overflow-x: hidden; }

Replace any width: 100vw causing drift → use width: 100%.

Ensure containers use:

max-width: 1200px

margin: 0 auto

padding: 0 16px

Check and confirm drift fixed on:

Home, Courses, Learning Path, Tools, Blog, News, Pricing, PDF Thankyou section

✅ TASK 2: GLOBAL PREMIUM FONT SCALING

Implement premium typography:

Base: 16px

H1: clamp(28px, 3vw, 44px)

H2: clamp(22px, 2.2vw, 32px)

Body text: clamp(15px, 1.1vw, 18px)

Increase line-height:

paragraphs 1.6

Buttons:

font-weight 600

font-size 14-16px

Ensure mobile text never looks too small.

Apply this consistently across the site.

✅ TASK 3: REPLACE AVATARS EVERYWHERE

Search whole project and replace avatar usage with ONLY transparent main versions:

Use ONLY:

priya_transparent.png

rohit_transparent.png

Ensure:

No reference left to avatar_old folder.

All components (CharacterCard, StoryStrip, StoryIntro, chat bubbles, WhatsApp widget) use the same transparent avatars.

✅ TASK 4: PREMIUM PDF THANKYOU SECTION REDESIGN

Redesign the Thankyou / PDF area into a premium confirmation layout:

Layout:

Left: “Dhanyavaad ✅ PDF Ready” premium card

Right: “PDF mein kya milega?” premium feature list with icons

Add below: Next step bar (Level 1 button + WhatsApp share)

Premium Features to add:

✅ Trust: “10,000+ learners downloaded”
✅ “No spam — only learning”
✅ “Instant access”
✅ Smooth animation on load (fade/slide)
✅ Hover lift on cards (subtle)

CTA Buttons:

Download PDF (Primary)

Start Level 1 (Secondary)

Share on WhatsApp (Outline)

Make it responsive:

Desktop = 2 columns

Mobile = stacked cards

Upgrade WhatsApp widget to look like premium support:

Header:

Priya avatar

“Priya Verified ✅”

“Reply within 1 minute”

Buttons:
