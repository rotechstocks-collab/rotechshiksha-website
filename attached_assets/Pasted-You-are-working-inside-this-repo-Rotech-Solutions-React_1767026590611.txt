You are working inside this repo: Rotech-Solutions (React + Wouter + Tailwind, Radix UI).
Goal: Fix the website layout/scroll bugs without removing any pages/routes/components.
Do NOT delete MarketTicker or any page.
All changes must be minimal, stable, and reversible.

Problems to fix (must solve ALL):

Header + MarketTicker are fixed top. At 90% / 100% / 125% zoom, content gets clipped or extra white band appears. The page top padding doesn’t consistently match header height.

Scroll lock gets stuck after opening/closing header Sheet/Dropdown or changing routes. Body overflow stays hidden; page becomes unscrollable or looks blank.

Dark theme overlay / hero background mismatch on Pricing and Home: harsh transitions / bands.

Replit HMR sometimes gets stale and changes don’t reflect reliably — ensure the fix is robust without requiring hacks.

Hard constraints:

Keep MarketTicker visible at top (do not remove).

Do not remove any routes/pages/tools.

Do not add heavy MutationObserver/interval loops that cause instability.

Only fix layout/scroll/overlay bugs.

Must work reliably in Chrome desktop, 90/100/125 zoom.

Required implementation plan (do exactly this):
A) Make header offset stable

The header wrapper has id app-header and is fixed top-0.

Implement a simple and reliable header height measurement and store it in CSS var --app-header-offset.

Use:

useLayoutEffect (preferred) or useEffect if needed

ResizeObserver on #app-header

also update on window.resize and visualViewport.resize

Provide fallback: if header height is 0, set default offset = 120px.

B) Ensure main content always starts below header

Ensure <main> (or main container) has: padding-top: var(--app-header-offset)

Ensure the layout wrapper uses min-h-[100svh] and no overflow: hidden on main containers.

C) Fix stuck scroll lock globally

Create a small utility in App.tsx: clearScrollLock() that resets:

document.body.style.overflow = ""

document.documentElement.style.overflow = ""

remove any data-scroll-locked attribute

remove paddingRight/position/top applied by scroll-lock systems

Run clearScrollLock():

on every route change

on visibilitychange when visible

on Escape key

when a Radix Sheet/Dropdown closes (see next)

D) Fix Header.tsx Sheet/Dropdown cleanup

In Header.tsx, the mobile menu uses Radix Sheet.

Ensure the Sheet open state is controlled (useState open).

When Sheet closes (onOpenChange(false)), call clearScrollLock() (import from a small util or define locally).

Also ensure Dropdown menus don’t leave overlays behind.

E) Fix dark theme banding

Audit Home hero + Pricing hero sections:

Avoid hard-coded light backgrounds in dark mode

Use theme variables (bg-background, from-background, to-background, etc.)

Ensure transitions are consistent and no white bands appear.

Deliverables:

Show exact file changes you made (App.tsx, Header.tsx, any CSS file).

Explain why each change fixes the bug.

Ensure no new warnings/errors.

Run the app and verify: Home + Pricing at 90/100/125 zoom, open/close menu, route changes — scroll must never get stuck.

If any part is unclear, inspect existing code instead of guessing.
