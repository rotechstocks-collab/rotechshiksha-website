You are working inside this repo (React + Wouter + Tailwind, Radix UI).
Goal: Fix layout/scroll/theme banding bugs permanently with MINIMAL reversible changes.
Do NOT remove MarketTicker or any page/route/component. No heavy MutationObserver/interval loops.

1) Verify header offset system is correct (must be stable at 90/100/125 zoom)

Confirm App.tsx is measuring BOTH:

MarketTicker element (data-ticker)

Header wrapper (#app-header)

Confirm it sets CSS var --app-header-offset on document.documentElement.

Must include fallback: if measured height is 0, set offset = 120px.

Ensure updates happen on:

ResizeObserver (header + ticker)

window.resize

visualViewport.resize (if available)

2) Ensure main content always starts below fixed header+ticker

Ensure the main layout container uses:

padding-top: var(--app-header-offset)

min-h-[100svh] (or equivalent)

Ensure no parent wrappers apply overflow: hidden in a way that can clip content.

3) Scroll lock must never get stuck

Confirm clearScrollLock() exists (lib/scrollLock.ts) and resets:

body/html overflow

position/top/paddingRight

removes data-scroll-locked (and any radix/scroll-lock leftovers)

Ensure App.tsx calls clearScrollLock():

on every route change

on visibilitychange when document becomes visible

on Escape key

Ensure Header.tsx uses controlled Radix Sheet open state and calls clearScrollLock() whenever Sheet closes.

Also confirm Dropdown/Popover does not leave overlays behind.

4) FIX dark theme banding / harsh hero transitions (THIS IS REQUIRED)

IMPORTANT: Remove hard-coded inline background:

In client/src/pages/Home.tsx and client/src/pages/PricingPage.tsx, replace:
style={{ backgroundColor: '#f7f9fc' }}

Use theme-safe Tailwind instead:

wrapper: bg-background text-foreground

if gradient needed: use bg-gradient-to-b from-background to-background (or subtle dark variants) but NEVER hard-code light colors.

Ensure Home + Pricing look consistent in dark mode (no white/grey bands at top or between sections).

5) Verification steps (must do before final response)

Run the app and manually verify in Chrome desktop:

Home + Pricing at 90%, 100%, 125% zoom

open/close mobile menu

open dropdowns

route changes back and forth

scroll must never freeze; no blank page; no clipped content.

Report exact file diffs (only the minimal files touched):

App.tsx (if changed)

Header.tsx (if changed)

Home.tsx (must change)

PricingPage.tsx (must change)

any CSS file if needed

No new warnings/errors.

Do the changes now.
