IMPORTANT RULE: Do NOT delete or remove the Market Ticker. It must remain visible across all pages.
I want you to redesign the Market Ticker into a premium Zerodha Varsity-style ticker with clean UI + great UX + performance.

✅ GOAL

Make ticker feel modern, clean, soft, and premium:

Subtle dark background

Soft colors (no neon)

Smooth scroll

Mobile-friendly

Interactive controls (LIVE badge, refresh, search, speed)

✅ 1) UI DESIGN (Premium Look)

Update ticker styling:

Height: 38px

Background: #0b1220 (premium navy-dark)

Text color: #e5e7eb

Border-bottom: border-b border-white/10

Shadow: shadow-sm

Font size: 12px

Each stock item should look like a “soft chip”:

bg-white/5 rounded-lg px-3 py-1

hover: bg-white/10

Red: #dc2626, Green: #16a34a

Use tabular numbers for prices:

font-variant-numeric: tabular-nums

✅ 2) LEFT SIDE CONTROLS (Professional)

Add a left segment (sticky inside ticker) containing:
✅ LIVE badge

● LIVE

small green dot + live text

Tooltip: “Live market updates”

✅ Search icon

on click opens small inline search input (not a big modal)

user can type a stock name and ticker should filter to match

✅ Refresh icon

on click re-fetches stock data

show small spinner animation while refreshing

✅ Speed toggle (3 steps only)
Add a simple toggle:

Slow

Normal (default)

Fast

Save selected speed in localStorage so user preference stays.

✅ 3) UX REQUIREMENTS

Ticker scroll should pause on hover (desktop)

On mobile: allow swipe horizontal scrolling

On mobile: show only first 3–4 chips at once (compact mode) but swipe can reveal more

Ensure ticker never overlaps navbar or blocks clicks

✅ 4) PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS

Start ticker animation after 1 second delay (setTimeout)

Use CSS animation or requestAnimationFrame for smooth scrolling (no jank)

Prevent layout shift (CLS)

If API fails:

show: “Live market data loading…” (not blank)

keep ticker stable

✅ 5) STRUCTURE (Clean Code)

If ticker is currently inside Navbar, extract it into:
client/src/components/market/MarketTicker.tsx
Keep it reusable and isolated.
Also create helper:
client/src/lib/tickerUtils.ts
for:

filter logic

format price

speed config

✅ 6) FINAL VERIFY

Verify:
✅ Desktop: pause on hover works
✅ Mobile: swipe works + compact chips show
✅ Search filters correctly
✅ Refresh fetches correctly
✅ Speed toggle works and persists
✅ Ticker always visible (NOT removed)

Output:

List all files modified

Show MarketTicker.tsx final code

Show tickerUtils.ts if created

Confirm verification completed
