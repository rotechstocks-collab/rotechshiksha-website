You are working on rotechshiksha.com (React + TS + Tailwind + shadcn + Radix UI + wouter).
STRICT RULES:
- DO NOT delete any pages/routes.
- DO NOT remove or change the top market ticker (must stay).
- Keep SEBI-safe copy rules intact.
- Make minimal, surgical diffs.

PROBLEM:
At 100% zoom the site does not look “proper”: large blank space appears above hero / content feels shifted or clipped.
Dark theme visibility is fixed, but layout/spacing at 100% zoom is still wrong.
This is likely due to header+ticker combined height mismatch, pixel rounding, and route scroll restoration.

GOAL:
Permanently stabilize layout at 100% zoom and prevent any “shift/blank area” on load or after navigation/theme toggle.

----------------------------------------------------------------
TASK 1 — Implement stable header offset using CSS variable (mandatory)
1) In client/src/index.css (or global CSS used by app):
   - Add CSS variables for combined fixed header height (ticker + navbar).
   - Use separate values for desktop and mobile.
   Append this EXACT block near top (or bottom) of the file:

:root{
  --app-header-offset: 104px; /* desktop: ticker + navbar combined */
}
@media (max-width: 768px){
  :root{
    --app-header-offset: 56px; /* mobile header */
  }
}

2) In the main layout (client/src/App.tsx), locate the <main> element that currently uses
   something like "pt-14 md:pt-[102px]" or similar.
   Replace that padding-top with:
   pt-[var(--app-header-offset)]

Example:
<main className="pt-[var(--app-header-offset)] relative min-h-[100svh] overflow-visible ...">

IMPORTANT:
- Do NOT remove any content.
- Only change the padding-top strategy to use the variable.
- If <main> contains "z-0", change it to "z-10" to avoid stacking/clip issues.

----------------------------------------------------------------
TASK 2 — Force scroll-to-top on route change (mandatory)
In client/src/App.tsx where wouter location changes are handled:
- Add an effect that runs on every route change and forces scroll to top (no smooth scrolling).
Use exactly:

useEffect(() => {
  window.scrollTo(0, 0);
}, [location]);

This prevents pages loading “scrolled down” which looks like blank space/shift at 100% zoom.

----------------------------------------------------------------
TASK 3 — Keep scroll unlock safety net (mandatory)
If App.tsx still has scroll-lock hard unlock logic, keep it.
If it still contains hasOpenOverlay()/safeUnlockScroll(), REMOVE those and ensure unlock is unconditional.

Minimum required:
- Have unlockScroll() that resets body/html overflow + removes data-scroll-locked
- Run unlock on route change (setTimeout 0 ok)
- MutationObserver force unlock if overflow hidden or data-scroll-locked detected

DO NOT block unlock based on overlay detection.

----------------------------------------------------------------
TASK 4 — Prevent wrapper overflow traps (mandatory)
Search for any global wrapper that applies "overflow-hidden" on body/html/root containers.
- Keep overflow-x-hidden allowed, but remove overflow-hidden that can clip content.
Set:
html, body { height: 100%; overflow-x: hidden; }
Do NOT set overflow-y hidden globally.

----------------------------------------------------------------
VALIDATION (must confirm)
After changes:
1) At 100% zoom, Home hero should start correctly under ticker+navbar with no large blank area.
2) Navigate Home -> Pricing -> Home: page must start at top, no shifted view.
3) Dark mode toggle must not break layout or hide content.
4) Ticker remains intact and visible.

Deliver:
- Show a brief diff summary (which files changed and what).
- Ensure TypeScript builds successfully.
