You are a senior React + Tailwind + Wouter expert developer. You must fix a UI bug without breaking any existing routes, pages, or components.

PROJECT CONTEXT:

Website: rotechshiksha.com (React + TS + Tailwind, Wouter routing)

Header has 2 parts: MarketTicker + Navbar (Header component)

Header is fixed at top.

Main content sometimes has extra top gap depending on zoom level.

At 100% zoom the spacing becomes inconsistent across pages.

The layout must be stable at all zoom levels (90% to 125%).

DO NOT delete any page/route.

DO NOT remove the MarketTicker.

DO NOT use heavy MutationObserver/ResizeObserver/VisualViewport hacks.

DO NOT add any scroll-lock recovery logic.

Make the smallest possible change.

BUG:
At 100% zoom, page content has extra empty space below header OR content starts too low. Sometimes differs page to page.

GOAL:
Make main content start EXACTLY below the fixed header (Ticker + Navbar) across all pages reliably.

STRICT FIX STRATEGY:

Use only CSS + minimal React.

Measure header height ONCE using a simple ref and set CSS variable.

Apply padding-top to main container using the CSS variable.

Provide a fallback fixed value for safety.

Ensure no double-padding happens.

Ensure no white screen / crash.

FILES YOU CAN EDIT (ONLY THESE):

client/src/App.tsx

client/src/index.css

REQUIREMENTS:

Implement a clean layout structure:

Fixed header wrapper

Main content wrapper with padding-top = header height

Use useLayoutEffect (not useEffect) for measuring header height.

Use a ref on the header wrapper instead of getElementById.

Set --app-header-height CSS variable on document.documentElement.

Fallback if header ref is missing: set it to 104px.

On window resize, update height (throttled).

Remove all previous header-offset, ResizeObserver, MutationObserver, VisualViewport logic if present.

Must not affect scroll behavior.

Must not change theme/dark mode.

OUTPUT FORMAT:
Give exact final code blocks for:

App.tsx (only changed part with full component)

index.css additions
Explain in 3 bullets why it fixes zoom gap.

DO NOT DO:

Do not modify other files

Do not remove any routes

Do not delete components

Do not touch MarketTicker

Do not add any portal cleanup

Do not add scroll lock recovery

Proceed carefully. Output only code + short explanation.
